# Head-Soccer-Unity
This Unity project contains a Head Soccer Game. We give credits for the graphics to @wjhowell, that has uploaded them in this repository: https://github.com/wjhowell/BigHeadSoccer. 
We have developed 3 GameModes:
  - Survival -> the goal is to win as many matches as possible. When you loose your first one, you will be kicked out of the game. 
  - Arcade -> play against an AI on a single match. 
  - Player vs Player -> play a single match against another player in the same computer.

After deciding the Game Mode, the user/s must decide the real world players they are going to take to the game. When they are ready, they respective match will be launched. If the selected GameMode is survival, when a match is finished, the game will launch the next oponent. 

The player controls are quite easy. When playing against the AI, the user control the right hand side player and moves it with the arrows. The kick is with the space bar. However, when you play against another user, the player on the left hand side uses w/s/a/d to move the player and kicks with the TAB. Other controls like pausing the menu (P) or executing an action (Enter or Escape) are described in game.
